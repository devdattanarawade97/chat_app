Sure, here's the documentation without the code:

---

### **Code Documentation:**

This is an Express.js server that uses `socket.io` for real-time communication between clients. The server manages a list of users, allows them to join a chat, send messages, and handles their disconnections.

---

### **Dependencies:**
- **`express`**: A web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests.
- **`http`**: Native Node.js module to create an HTTP server.
- **`socket.io`**: Real-time communication library to establish WebSocket connections.
- **`cors`**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the frontend to communicate with the backend.

---


### **Server Setup:**

1. **Express Application**:
   - `express` is used to create an Express app (`app`).
   - The HTTP server is created using `http.createServer(app)` to enable Socket.IO functionality.

2. **Socket.IO Setup**:
   - The `Server` class from `socket.io` is instantiated with the HTTP server and configured to allow CORS for a frontend running on `http://localhost:3000`.
   - CORS allows the frontend to make requests to the server from a different domain or port.

3. **CORS Middleware**:
   - `app.use(cors())` enables CORS for all incoming requests, allowing communication from the frontend.

---

### **Variables:**
- **`PORT`**: Defines the port the server listens on, in this case, `5000`.
- **`users`**: An array that stores the current list of connected users. Each user has an `id` (Socket ID) and a `username`.

---

### **Socket.IO Event Handlers:**

1. **`connection`**:
   - Listens for new socket connections.
   - Once a user connects, it logs the userâ€™s socket ID (`socket.id`) and handles subsequent events for that socket.

2. **`join` event**:
   - This event is emitted by the client when a user joins the chat.
   - The server adds the user (with the provided `name` and `socket.id`) to the `users` list.
   - After adding the user, the server emits the updated list of users to all connected clients using `io.emit('updateUserList', users)`.
   - A console log confirms the user has joined.

3. **`disconnectNow` event**:
   - This event is triggered when a user decides to disconnect from the chat.
   - The server removes the user from the `users` list based on their `socket.id`.
   - The updated list of users is then emitted to all connected clients.
   - A console log confirms the user has disconnected.

4. **`sendMessage` event**:
   - This event is triggered when a client sends a message to another user.
   - The server emits the message to the intended recipient via `io.to(recipient).emit('receiveMessage', { sender, message })`.
   - This ensures that the message is sent to the correct user.

---

### **Server Listening:**
- The server listens for incoming HTTP requests on port `5000`. 
- A console log is shown when the server is running: `"Server running on http://localhost:5000"`.

---

### **Flow Summary:**
1. The server listens for `join`, `disconnectNow`, and `sendMessage` events from the clients.
2. When a user joins, their name is added to the `users` list, and the updated list is sent to all connected clients.
3. When a user sends a message, it is delivered directly to the recipient.
4. When a user disconnects, their entry is removed from the `users` list, and the updated list is sent to all clients.

This structure allows for a basic real-time chat application, with a user list and message handling features.
